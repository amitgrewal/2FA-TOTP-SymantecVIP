# 2FA-TOTP-SymantecVIP

This repository contains code, links, and details that explain how to
use a Symantec VIP authentication credential with standardized 2FA apps
using the TOTP protocol (Google Authenticator, etc.)

The tools and code included in this repository allow you to generate a new
Symantec VIP credential that includes the Symantec-specific credential ID,
the standardized secret (key/code for TOTP) and customizable QR codes
(custom issuer and label for better organization) that allow you to easily
add the credential to most 2FA programs that support TOTP.
